Cloud Computing for Scientific Applications
===================

This project presents a solution for the execution of biological software that allows to reveal the complex embryonic development that use fluorescence correlation spectroscopy under the cloud computer paradigm.

Microsoft Azure technologies were used to implement a highly scalable and accessible architecture.

The implementation makes use of high performance algorithms such as a load balancer or parametric sweep on distributed systems.
